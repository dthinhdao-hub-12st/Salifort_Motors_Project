📁 Project Folder: Salifort_Motors_Project
This folder contains the work of Dao Duc Thinh for the Salifort Motors Project, introduced by Google Career Advanced Data Analysis Certificate.

🎯 Objectives
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee turnover rate at the company. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company?
The goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company. Leaving, in this case, includes voluntarily quit and terminated by reconstruction or poor performance. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
